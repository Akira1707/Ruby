The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today.
Do not watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.
Stay hungry, stay foolish.
Ruby and Python can talk together.
Programming is the art of logic and creation.
