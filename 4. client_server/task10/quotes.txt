The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today.
Do not watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.
Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
The purpose of our lives is to be happy.
